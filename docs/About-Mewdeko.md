## Cute but *Powerful.* ( ◕‿◕✿)
Mewdeko is a bot that combines customization, moderation and other community-enhancing features and tools to your Discord server.

### Fun.
Above all, this bot is made to make your server work for you and your community - including cute games, surprises, and more!
- Custom bot responses and reactions! Have your bot do something silly, cute, fun or useful in response to a set phrase or pattern!
- MultiGreet system - the most expansive of any bot - brings you the ability to set up many customized greetings for user joins!
    - Up to 30 different MultiGreets per instance!
    - Up to 5 different greetings per channel!
    - Each MultiGreet is configurable and customizable - to post a webhook, to auto-delete after a specified timeout, and to embed custom formatted messages or media per greeting!
    - We're really proud of it. ( ◡‿◡✿)
- *hi do u rp? mew can help nya~* Mewdeko gives you powerful roleplay commands, for everything from a light jaunt to a years-long campaign.
- Starboard! You see a post that, gosh, you just *have* to show everyone? React with a ⭐ (or an emoji set up for the board!) and it will be pinned on the fridge for all to enjoy. Congrats, you did the thing.

### Friendly.
Mewdeko is geared to be usable and customizable to fit the needs of managers, moderators, users and guests alike.
- An extremely capable AFK system provides notice when a user has gone away briefly, including to grab an energy drink, coffee, hot cocoa or tea...
- ... and a notice when they return, too - at your option. The AFK system is deeply customizable and makes your presence known. *Or not known.* ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
- Mewdeko is a skilled markskitty and a trained sniper. You can take advantage of her excellent sniping powers easily, with powerful quick-snipe commands, plus a snipelist!

### Safe.
Mewdeko comes with claws and is ready to rip wrongdoers a new-- *uh,* to protect your community from devastation, and denounce the evils of... *where were we?*
- Protection features against raids and multi-user attack patterns (clustered join time, brand new account, etc).
- Clean-up features, for raids, or that one time Carl posted his macaroni and cheese casserole in #suggestions 52 times by accident. We know, Carl, it's excellent.
- Two independent user-warn systems, for effective and efficient tiered moderation and response with one bot.

### Manageable.
Mew can do it, and we can help, *nya!*
- Create and remove multiple channels instantly, in a specified order, in an existing or new category, without having to move them.
- Complete, fine-grained permissions and access control for most, if not all, bot capabilities and functions.
- Perform commands on individual users, or entire roles, with one swift action. Mewdeko has you covered.
- Sticky messages! Have something important to say? Have it stuck on the channel, and it will follow the conversation as it rolls on by.
- Repeating messages! Have lots of new joins posting too quickly for your important messages to stay on? Use the timed repeat feature to post it as often as you need.


### Reliable.
- Mewdeko maintains a 99.95% uptime rate on its central instance. (The little downtime there is, has been attributed to server maintenance or incidents outside of Mewdeko.)
- Being open-source (under the [AGPL v3](https://github.com/Sylveon76/Mewdeko/blob/main/LICENSE)), Mewdeko's functionality is auditable, and anyone can [contribute fixes or features](https://github.com/Sylveon76/Mewdeko/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), and [report problems](https://github.com/Sylveon76/Mewdeko/issues) as they come up.
