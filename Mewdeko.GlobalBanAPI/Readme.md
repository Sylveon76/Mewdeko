# Welcome to the Global Ban API

## If you are wondering how it'll work, here's how:

- Trusted users receive api keys to add bans to this api
- Data is first reviewed then approved
- Once approved, its added to redis for faster fetching
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent from ddos attacks


## Self hosting is really easy, just install .net8 and redis and you're good to go!
